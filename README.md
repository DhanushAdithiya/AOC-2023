# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2023 puzzles implemented in Rust.

## Usage

- Run `cargo test` to execute the test cases.
- Run `cargo run --bin day{day_number}` to evaluate the solution for a specific day.

Replace `{day_number}` with the actual day you want to run (e.g., `cargo run --bin day1`).

## Structure

- `src/bin`: Contains the source code for each day's solution.
- `inputs/`: Stores input files required for solving the problems.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin day{day_number}
